## Decision log

| # | Date | Decision | Reason | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-10-30 | Add EXPERIMENT entity; combination counts use experiments | "Used together" instead of "co-occurs" | Locked |
| 2 | 2026-10-30 | RESULT links to EXPERIMENT | Metrics belong to a method-dataset pair | Locked |
| 3 | 2026-10-30 | Alias tables and closed vocabulary | Entity normalization | Locked |
| 4 | 2026-10-30 | Extraction provenance on every extracted link | Measurable errors; UI evidence | Locked |
| 5 | 2026-10-30 | Add SETTING and INSTITUTION tables, author order, composite PKs | Schema completeness | Locked |
| 6 | 2026-10-30 | Sparsity uses observed vs expected, with confidence | Raw counts are misleading | Locked |
| 7 | 2026-10-30 | All signals normalized to [0, 1]; per-signal values shown; sensitivity check | Transparent scoring | Locked |
| 8 | 2026-10-30 | Start with three signals; add two only if they change the ranking | Reduce risk | Locked |
| 9 | 2026-10-30 | Pairs first; triples are stretch | Scope, explosion | Locked |
| 10 | 2026-10-30 | Temporal holdout plus baselines are the primary evaluation | Strongest label-free test | Locked |
| 11 | 2026-10-30 | DBMS benchmarks required | Course alignment | Locked |
| 12 | 2026-10-30 | Evidence as structured JSON first; RAG phrases it; citations verified | Grounding | Locked |
| 13 | 2026-10-30 | Nearest-existing-work section on every opportunity | Guards against false gaps | Locked |
| 14 | 2026-10-30 | Neo4j is a derived projection with idempotent batch sync | Consistency | Locked |
| 15 | 2026-10-30 | Context files kept to five plus `docs/reference/` (all inside `context/`); add more only when decisions settle | Avoid stale specs | Locked |
| 16 | 2026-10-30 | Same-universe rule for expected counts; subset count views and `mv_universe_size` added | Mixed universes inflate expected counts and create false sparsity | Locked |
| 17 | 2026-10-30 | `experiment` uniqueness uses `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`; PostgreSQL 15+ required | Prevent duplicate extractions with missing fields | Locked |
| 18 | 2026-10-30 | Values outside the controlled vocabulary go to a review queue, never create entities | Keep the vocabulary controlled | Locked |
| 19 | 2026-10-30 | Postgres container is built from `db/Dockerfile` (`postgres:16` pinned by digest, plus apt `postgresql-16-pgvector` pinned) instead of the `pgvector/pgvector` image, because that image fails with `exec format error` on Person 2's Docker setup; one identical image for everyone | Reproducible environment | Confirmed by Person 3 on 2026-11-01: built from db/Dockerfile with docker compose up -d --build, first time OK, 66 integration tests pass against it, init.sql identical to the contract |
| 20 | 2026-10-31 | Embedding model is SPECTER2 with the proximity adapter; `vector(768)` unchanged | Runs on CPU at about 0.13 s per paper, 768-dim output matches the schema; see `db/experiments/embeddings/results.md` | Proposed |
| 21 | 2026-11-01 | Postgres and Neo4j host ports are configurable via db/.env (POSTGRES_PORT, NEO4J_HTTP_PORT, NEO4J_BOLT_PORT), defaults unchanged | A local PostgreSQL service can own 5432 | Locked |

## Progress

Update after each task: what's done, what's next, blockers.

### Person 1: Data and extraction (then UI)
- Status: not started

### Person 2: Database and retrieval (then evidence and RAG)
- Status: week-1 foundation done (branch `db/foundation`).
- Done: schema and containers (Postgres 16.15 + pgvector 0.8.7, Neo4j 5.26.32; schema from the contracts loaded verbatim via `db/init.sql`); 76 tests passing; loader (vocabulary, papers, extractions, refresh, load-all) done and run on the mock data in `db/mock/`; proposals for the paper metadata and vocabulary formats written in `db/proposals/`, awaiting Person 1's confirmation.
- Done (embeddings): SPECTER2 measured on CPU (about 0.13 s per paper, 768-dim; `db/experiments/embeddings/results.md`); embedding pipeline `embed-papers` in `db/embeddings/` built with tests (stub encoder, plus one `slow` real-model test) and run on the mock papers.
- Confirmed: decision #19 (Postgres built from `db/Dockerfile`), by Person 3 on 2026-11-01. Proposed, awaiting teammates: O3 / decision #20 (SPECTER2 with the proximity adapter, `vector(768)` unchanged). Real papers are not embedded until O3 is confirmed.
- Done (retrieval): SQL search layer in `db/retrieval/` with tests: vector search (year, venue, method/dataset/task filters with aliases, offset, exclusions, optional entity names) using pgvector iterative index scans for selective filters, and a full-text keyword baseline. Entity filters by default need one experiment to satisfy all of them (`match="same_experiment"`; `match="any"` allows different experiments). No API (Person 3 owns it). Tested on synthetic vectors only; no real embeddings exist yet.
- Done (ports): host ports are configurable in `db/.env` (decision #21) because a local PostgreSQL service can own 5432; the loaders, embedding and search commands and the tests all read `POSTGRES_PORT`. Defaults are unchanged. 196 tests pass in the embeddings environment (185 passed and 11 skipped in the root environment, where the embeddings tools are not installed).
- Done (evaluation): retrieval metrics (precision@K, recall@K, MRR, nDCG@K with graded relevance) and a runner that scores precomputed ranking files, in `db/retrieval/evaluation/` with hand-computed tests; no database or model involved. Query-set format written as a proposal (`db/proposals/retrieval-eval-format.md`), awaiting the team.
- Next: embedding the real corpus once O3 is confirmed, labelling 15-20 queries, and the keyword-vs-vector evaluation. The query encoder (`specter2_adhoc_query` adapter vs the proximity adapter) is not implemented; it will be compared on the labelled query set once real papers exist.
- Notes: Neo4j credentials are in the local `db/.env` (not committed); share them with Person 3 outside git.

### Person 3: Graph and analysis (then scoring and API)
- Status: not started
